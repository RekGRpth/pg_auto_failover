# This script uses the `cscope` tool to find all the call sites for
# strerror() and checks that none of them are an assignement, which would be
# against the security policy.
#
# When an assignment is found, the script exists with a non-zero code.
#
# Note that at the moment our source code only uses strerror in log_...()
# calls, such as the followings:
#
# src/bin/pg_autoctl/keeper.c:1004 log_fatal("fsync error: %s", strerror(errno));
#
# In the worst case we had to read 2 lines behind the matching line, so our
# logic to complete the code is very very simple.
